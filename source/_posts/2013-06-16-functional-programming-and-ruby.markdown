Functional Programming ("FP") wasn't on my radar until I started hacking at The Flatiron School two weeks ago (and by _hacking_ I mean as in a _hacking cough_ :). 

Since my ego is super attracted to highbrow challenges and feeling intellectually superior, when I heard that FP was baller status because it's both exceedingly powerful and exceedingly difficult to master, my interest was piqued. When I saw this speakerdeck presentation from Pat Shaughnessy ((["Get yo ass down to O'Shag Hennessy!" "Who?" "O'Shag Hennessy!!" "Principal O'Shaughnessy???"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw))) analyzing Ruby's relationship to FP I was like, "challah!"

And here it is:

## Say, what is functional programming anyway?

+ Higher order functions, bro.

+ LAZY evaluation ([definition:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) _Lazy evaluation delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations. _)

+ Memoization ([definition:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) _Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by having function calls avoid repeating the calculation of results for previously processed inputs._)

### An email from Matz! => 

+ **Check out this screenshot of an old-school email from Matz.** 
+ **Why aren't we calling Ruby "MatzLisp"?!**

## Ruby, and in particular Ruby 2.0, has a lot of functional features. _However..._

+ **Ruby and Haskell can resemble each other, but only on the surface.**

+ **Under the hood, Ruby's support of functional features is limited.**

+ **Close, but no cigar!**

## In Conclusion

+ **Learning a truly functional programming language won't be trivial.**




=======
You probably read the deck, but if you didn't, here are a few takeaways from it. 

### Amaaazing :-D !

+ 
+ 
+ 

### But I'm still confused :-/ ?

+ 
+ 
+ 


One of the coolest factoids is a screenshot of an old-school email from Matz to another developer explaining that Ruby might best be thought of MatzLisp.
