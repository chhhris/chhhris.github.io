# Functional Ruby

Functional Programming ("FP") wasn't on my radar until I started hacking at The Flatiron School two weeks ago (and by _hacking_ I mean as in a _hacking cough_ :). 

Since my ego is super attracted to highbrow challenges and feeling intellectually superior, when I heard that FP was baller status because it's both exceedingly powerful and exceedingly difficult to master, my interest was piqued. When I saw this speakerdeck presentation from Pat Shaughnessy ((["Get yo ass down to O'Shag Hennessy!" "Who?" "O'Shag Hennessy!!" "Principal O'Shaughnessy???"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw))) analyzing Ruby's relationship to FP I was like, "challah!"

And here it is:

You probably read the deck, but if you didn't, here are a few takeaways from it. 

### Amaaazing :-D !

### But I'm still confused :-/ ?

One of the coolest factoids is a screenshot of an old-school email from Matz to another developer explaining that Ruby might best be thought of MatzLisp.
