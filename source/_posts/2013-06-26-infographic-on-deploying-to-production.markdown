# Infographic: From Development to Production

We had an awesome guest lecture from Spike Grobstein today on deploying from development to a live, production server on Digital Ocean. 

[Spike](https://github.com/spikegrobstein) was kind enough to provide [written instructions](https://github.com/spikegrobstein/flatironschool-deployment_lecture) that were both thorough and crystal clear. 

After a long few weeks of boot camp I decided to give my left brain a rest, let my right brain go to town, and memorialize Spike's lecture in this infographic.
