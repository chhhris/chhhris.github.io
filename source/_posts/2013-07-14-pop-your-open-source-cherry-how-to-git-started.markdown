# Open Source is Super Easy

### Contributing to Open Source projects is way easier than getting laid ;)

There are loads of ways to contribute to your favorite open source projects. I list out a bunch of them below. 

I'll also discuss how I ate my own dog food, mostly because I love using that expression. Altho I was actually pretty excited to submit my first open source pull request.

## Gitting started.

Working on any open source project on GitHub is just as easy as working on your own team projects. If you know how to use GitHub, you know how to contribute to open source. 

Take Ruby, for example. To paraphrase the rubyist [Mike Perham](http://www.mikeperham.com/2010/12/08/contributing-to-ruby/) (who you probs don't read but definitely should), Ruby Core has made contributing as simple as:

- **Fork the Ruby repo** - <http://github.com/ruby/ruby>
- Make changes and commit them to **your repo** -- e.g. <https://github.com/chhhris/ruby>
- Send a **pull request** - GitHub has a great primer at <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>

## Ways to contribute.
I think it's fairly common knowledge that you don't have to be a prodigy to contribute to meaningful open source projects. And that's especially true because there are so many ways to contribute. 

I've adapted [Andy Lester's post](http://blog.smartbear.com/programming/14-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-being-a-programming-genius-or-a-rock-star/) on Smart Bear to list some easy, helpful ways to get your feet wet.
